# Simple Chat Application with AI Assistant

This is a chat application developed using Streamlit and Langchain Python libraries. The primary functionality of the application is to facilitate interaction between users and an artificial intelligence assistant.

## Overview

The key features provided by the application include:

1. **AI Assistant**: The application incorporates an artificial intelligence assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. This assistant can comprehend user queries and generate responses based on a specific set of documents.

2. **Document Loading**: By loading documents from a specified directory, the application utilizes them to generate responses for the AI assistant. These documents serve as the basis for the assistant's answers.

3. **Chat Interface**: Developed using Streamlit, the application offers a chat interface where users can input their queries and receive responses from the AI assistant. The chat interface provides an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Usage

To run the application, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file. Additionally, you need to set up an OpenAI API key and include it in the `.env` file before running the application.

Once the application is running, users can interact with the AI assistant by entering their queries into the text input box. The assistant will generate responses based on the provided documents and the user's input.
